# Category Hider

## Discourse Theme Component

This is a [Discourse](https://discourse.org) theme component that allows you to hide specific categories from various locations in the Discourse UI.

### Why would you need this component?

If your Discourse website has a lot of categories and you would like to hide some from appearing in either the menu bar or on the main page, this component can be helpful.

This theme component is more of a stylistic change. It hides desired categories visually, but still keeps notifications and all other functionality for the category intact. To turn off all category features it is recommended to mute a category instead.
